For my first project as a front end software developer, I created Sonic the Hedgehog Themed Music Library called Sonic Sound Oasis. 
This website hosts music from various Sonic game series. 
It has two basic controls: one a search button to where you can search the song you want to listen to that is available in our main library, and two a theme toggle checkbox to when you click on the the checkbox, it changes the inner contents of the .container background. 
This website is a working progress, for I will be updating changes to the website based on what users are looking for.
